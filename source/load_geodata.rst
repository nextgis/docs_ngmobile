   :align: center
   :width: 10cm
   
   Parameters of the new vector layer

The standard form for the creation of new vector layer contains the following parameters:

1. Layer name - enter the name of layer which will be displayed in the layers tree.
2. Geometry type - select layer geometry type (point, linestring, polygon, multipoint, multilinestring, multipolygon).
3. Fields - list of fields which can be added, edited or deleted. These are attribute values of the layer.

You can add as many attributes for a new vector layer as you like. To add a new attribute tap on "+" button next to "Fields". This will open a new dialogue for creation of each new field (see :numref:`ngmobile_dialogue_create_new_field_pic`).

.. figure:: _static/dialogue_create_new_field.png
   :name: ngmobile_dialogue_create_new_field_pic
   :align: center
   :width: 10cm

   Dialog for creation of a new field

Dialog for creation of a new field contains the following parameters:

1. Field name â€“ enter the name of the field.

.. note:: 
	The field name can only be entered in Latin characters (letters and numbers!) without spaces. It should also differ from SQL reserved keywords.

2. Field type - select field type from one of the following types: string, integer, biginteger, real, date&time, date, time.

.. _ngmobile_import_vector:

Creating vector layer from GeoJSON data
-----------------------------------------

NextGIS Mobile allows to create a vector layer by importing an existing GeoJSON file. To open data in GeoJSON format:

1. Open Layers tree panel (item 1 in :numref:`ngmobile_main_activity_pic_1`). Then tap on "Add geodata" button (item 4 in :numref:`ngmobile_layer_tree_pic`). The dialogue will open as shown in :numref:`ngmobile_options_menu_new_layer_pic`. Select "Open local".

2. Select GeoJSON file from your mobile device storage (see :numref:`ngmobile_saved_files_on_the_drive_pic_1`). For example, tap on the file "Roads.geojson" to import the "Roads" vector data file.

.. figure:: _static/saved_files_on_the_drive_unit.png
   :name: ngmobile_saved_files_on_the_drive_pic_1
   :align: center
   :width: 10cm
   
   Android local storage
   
3. When the file is selected Layer settings dialogue opens. Here you can specify a new vector layer name or keep the name as it is, e.g. "Roads" (see :numref:`ngmobile_layer_settings_geo_pic`).

.. figure:: _static/layer_settings_geo.png
   :name: ngmobile_layer_settings_geo_pic
   :align: center
   :width: 10cm

   Layer settings dialogue

4. Pressing "Create" button starts data processing for creation of a new layer. 

.. note::  
	In case of GeoJSON file importing the new layer will always be a vector layer!

You can check if the new layer was created successfully in the layers tree panel. The newly created layer will be shown up in the layers tree (see :numref:`ngmobile_tree_layers_geo_pic`). The "Roads" layer is marked in orange rectangle.

   Layers tree panel

**GeoJSON: format requirements**

* :term:`Coordinate system` of input geometries can be WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) or Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) only. If input file has different coordinate system you will see a warning message about unsupported coordinate system.
* All geometries in the file must be of the same type. If input file contains varying types of geometry in the output you will have a file with geometries type that coincides with the type of first record, i.e. geometry of first entry will determine the type of layer geometry.
* Text strings must be encoded in UTF-8 format.

.. note::
	You can read more about GeoJSON format in its `specification <http://geojson.org/>`_.
	GeoJSON is based on JSON format (see `RFC 4627 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt>`_).

You can only use standard attributes form (not custom *.ngfp form) for editing GeoJSON layer. 

The standard attributes form contains only following three fields:

1. Text field for entering characters or digits.
2. Dialogue for entering date & time.
3. "Add pictures" button.

A sample standard attributes form is shown below in :numref:`ngmobile_standard_input_form_attributes_pic`.

   :name: ngmobile_standard_input_form_attributes_pic
   :align: center
   :width: 10cm
   
   Standard attributes form
   
   The numbers indicate: 1 - Back to previous screen; 2 - Apply changes; 3 - Add pictures.

You can further perform standard edit operations like Add, Modify or Delete operations for this layer. For more information about GeoJSON layer editing see :ref:`ngmobile_edit_geometry`.

.. _ngmobile_import_ngfp:

Creating vector layer from Custom forms (NGFP)
-----------------------------------------------

NextGIS Mobile allows to create a vector layer by importing an existing NGFP file. 

NGFP files can be generated using `NextGIS FormBuilder <http://nextgis.com/nextgis-formbuilder/>`_. NGFP is a :term:`GeoJSON` file with additional information (JSON) which is packaged in zip archive and has .ngfp extension.

NGFP file allows to use custom (not standard) attributes forms optimized for attributes viewing and editing. Custom form may contain special controls for editing, such as dropdown lists, radio buttons or linked lists.

.. figure:: _static/custom_form.png
   :name: ngmobile_custom_form_pic

.. _ngmobile_import_cache:

Creating raster layer from Tile cache (XYZ/TMS)
------------------------------------------------

NextGIS Mobile allows to create a raster layer by importing tile cache. 

Tile cache is a zip-archive with folders and tiles stored in accordance with a tiling scheme (for example, folder_z/folder_x/y.png). Folders of level Z can be located in the root or in a folder in the root folder (name of the folder doesn't matter, but there have to be only one folder). Deeper nesting of level Z folders is not allowed.

Tile cache can be created with the extension module `NextGIS QGIS - QTiles <http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qtiles/>`_. 
Resulted archive can be uploaded to any available folder in your mobile device storage.

Follow these steps to open zip-archive with tile cache:

1. Open Layers tree panel (item 1 in :numref:`ngmobile_main_activity_pic_1`). Then tap on "Add geodata" button (item 4 in :numref:`ngmobile_layer_tree_pic`). The dialogue will open as shown in :numref:`ngmobile_options_menu_new_layer_pic`. Select "Open local".

2. Select zip-archive from your mobile device storage (see :numref:`ngmobile_files_on_the_drive_unit_tms_pic`). For example, tap on the file "mapnik.zip" to import the tile cache:

   :name: ngmobile_ngmobile_new_geoservice_pic
   :align: center
   :width: 10cm

   Create TMS service dialogue
   
2. Specify Layer name & Layer URL. Layer URL should specify location of X value (number of tile by horizontal), Y (number of tile by vertical) and Z (zoom level). These values are specified using wildcard code for X - **{x}**, for Y - **{y}**, for Z - **{z}**. Additionally you can specify subdomains (e.g. for subdomains a.tileopenstreetmap.org, b.tileopenstreetmap.org, c.tileopenstreetmap.org the address will look like this: **{a,b,c}.tile.openstreetmap.org**).

.. note::
   NextGIS Mobile requests tiles from each URL (subdomain) in 2 streams. So from URL like {a,b,c}.tile.openstreetmap.org tiles will be downloaded in 6 streams.

3. You can also specify Tile layer type (XYZ (OSM) and TMS (OSGeo) standards are supported), TMS in-memory cache size (none, 1, 2 or 3 screens) and credentials (Login & Password) if authentication is required for accessing tiles. 

.. note::
   Only `Basic access authentication <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication>`_ is currently supported.

4. Tap "Create" to create new raster layer from that TMS service. The newly created layer will be shown up in the layers tree in Layers tree.
