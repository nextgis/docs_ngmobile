Editing layers
=================

NextGIS Mobile allows you to edit vector layers added to the map. While editing, you can:

* add new features;
* delete features;
* edit features.

There are several ways to start editing. 
The first way is Main actions button (the big blue button in the right bottom corner of map screen (FAB)). Pressing Main actions button opens a menu of most common actions (see :numref:`ngmobile_edit_menu_pic`).

.. figure:: _static/edit_menu.png
   :name: ngmobile_edit_menu_pic
   :align: center
   :width: 6cm
   
   Common actions menu.

Using this menu you can:

* add a line or polygon by tracking;
* add geometry;
* add current location.

The second way to start editing is to long-press the geometry to switch map screen into Selection mode (see :numref:`ngmobile_selectmode_pic`) and then press "Edit" button in the Bottom toolbar.

Adding features
-----------------

To add feature to a vector layer press Main actions button, and then press a pencil icon (see :numref:`ngmobile_edit_menu_pic`). Select a layer you'd like to edit in an opened dialog (see :numref:`ngmobile_select_layer_dialogtch_pic`). 

.. figure:: _static/select_layer_dialogtch.png
   :name: ngmobile_select_layer_dialogtch_pic
   :align: center
   :width: 6cm
   
   Select layer dialog.

After you select a layer, map screen switches into Edit mode. Displayed editing tools depend on the geometry of a selected layer. You can create any type of geometry (points, lines, polygons, multipoints, multilines, multipolygons).

Adding a point
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a point to an existing layer first select a vector layer with point geometry (see :numref:`ngmobile_select_layer_dialogtch_pic`). Then press icon 3 in Bottom toolbar (see :numref:`ngmobile_edit_paneltch_pic`).

User can either edit an existing point or create a new one (new point will be created in the center of the screen). To start editing a point it should be selected by pressing on it. Selected point will be highlighted in red and have an arrow pointing at it.

To change location of a selected point simply pull it or arrow pointing at it to a desired place. Also a point can be moved using buttons from Bottom toolbar - to the center of the screen (see item 5 in :numref:`ngmobile_edit_point_pic`) or to the current device location (see item 6 in :numref:`ngmobile_edit_point_pic`).

By default the Cancel editing button (see item 2 in :numref:`ngmobile_edit_point_pic`) is shown only after any edits are made.

When polygon is being edited all vertices in that polygon are selected (in both outer ring and all inner rings). Current vertex is highlighted in red and has an arrow pointing at it. The centers of line segments between vertices in polygon rings (outer and inner) are also indicated. Pressing the center of line segment leads to new vertex being added to the polygon ring. New vertex can be moved or otherwise edited right after it has been added.

Polygon editing toolbar allows to delete either all vertices from polygon (delete polygon) or only selected vertex.

.. note::
   If only two vertices remain in a polygon this polygon is deleted automatically.

User can do the following operations with a selected vertex in polygon ring:

Editing attributes
--------------------

After layer is edited icon 1 in Bottom toolbar (see :numref:`ngmobile_edit_point_pic`) changes from "tick" to "floppy" and Cancel button appears.

Edit attributes dialog is a vertical list of field names and controls for each type of attributes:

* text field - for text and digits
* date picker - for date and time

.. note::
   If you close Edit attributes dialog without applying changes (pressing button 2 in :numref:`ngmobile_attributes_edit_pic`), all changes in the layer (added or edited geometries or attributes) will be lost.


Editing attributes using custom form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the layer includes customized attributes form, this form will be used in Edit attributes dialog instead of standard one (see :numref:`ngmobile_attributes_edit_pic`). Customized attributes form may contain the following entry fields:

* Text;
* Space;
* Text field;
* List; Tandem list;
* Checkbox;
* Radio button;
* Date Picker;
* Photo.

"Text" field is used to provide additional information about created geometry.
