   Share dialogue window.
   
After you select a share option, data in the selected layer will be recorded in :term:`GeoJSON` format (:term:`coordinate system` Web Mercator, EPSG:3857) and exported using the selected application. A name of the GeoJSON file corresponds to the name of the layer.

* You can send the file as attachment via your email App or Gmail.
* You can upload it to Google Drive, which may or may not be shared with your colleague.
* You can share it to another Android mobile via Bluetooth or SHAREit.
* You can even copy it on to your laptop via Bluetooth, if possible.

.. note::
   In a lot of Android versions to save a file on the device memory card you need a file manager app (for example, ES Explorer or similar).

Exporting attachments
-----------------------

Each feature in vector layer can have 1 or more photos attached to it. Photos are stored separately as image files and added to archive file with layer data during the export. For each feature a separate attachments folder is generated in the archive, the name of the folder correposnds to feature ID.

Example:

(4:10000002.jpg,10000000.jpg,10000001.jpg,10000003.jpg)

Explanation:

4 photos are attached to a feature. These 4 photos are stored in the folder which name correposnds to ID of this feature.
