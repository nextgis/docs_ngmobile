* perform map navigation (panning, zooming in and out);
* add vector data in :term:`GeoJSON` format;
* add raster data as a tile cache;
* add online tile sources (:term:`XYZ` and :term:`TMS`);
* add raster and vector layers from `nextgis.com <https://my.nextgis.com/signup/?next=/webgis/>`_ and `NextGIS Web <http://nextgis.com/nextgis-web/>`_;
* create and modify vector :term:`geodata` (geometries and attributes);
* browse the attributes of selected geometry through identify dialog;
* modify vector layer attributes with customizable input forms;
* share vector geodata using standard Android tools;
* record the tracks and manage their display parameters, remove selected or all tracks;
* display device coordinates, velocity, altitude on the map, as well as a source of geographical coordinates and amount of satellites used for georeferencing (when :term:`GPS` is in use);
* collect :term:`geodata` and transmit it to `nextgis.com <https://my.nextgis.com/signup/?next=/webgis/>`_ or `NextGIS Web <http://nextgis.com/nextgis-web/>`_ in background mode (when internet connection is on).

To be able to use all NextGIS Mobile features the device should have the following hardware:

* :term:`GPS` and/or :term:`GLONASS` sensor;
* digital compass;
* cellular module;
* rear camera.

.. note::

   If any of these items are missing from the device, the related functions will not be available.

NextGIS Mobile does not impose specific system requirements. However, the amount of system memory and storage space can limit the size of uploaded geodata.
