Application sign in
-------------------

What should the username and password be to sign in to NGM?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To sign in to NGM, you need to use NextGIS ID, account you've created while registering at my.nextgis.com
`Here <https://docs.nextgis.ru/docs_ngcom/source/create.html#nextgis-id/>`_ you can see how to get it.
If you created, but forgot the password for NextGIS ID, follow `password recovery instruction <https://docs.nextgis.ru/docs_ngcom/source/faq_webgis.html#q-nextgis-id/>`_. Note that log in part is optional and only needed if you'd like extended NGM functionality.

I sign in to NGM as administrator and the **application** shows an error. What am I doing wrong?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To sign in to NextGIS Mobile, you need to use **NextGIS ID**. Administrator is a Web GIS username local to this Web GIS. You cannot sign in to NGM with this name.
